Features: 

1. Classic MOBA Maps & 5v5 Battles 
Real-time 5v5 battles against real players. 3 lanes, 4 jungle areas, 2 bosses, 18 defense towers, and endless fights, everything a classic MOBA has is here!

2. Win with Teamwork & Strategy 
Block damage, control the enemy, and heal teammates! Choose from Tanks, Mages, Marksmen, Assassins, Supports, etc. to anchor your team and be match MVP! New heroes are constantly being released!

3. Fair Fights, Carry Your Team to Victory 
Just like classic MOBAs, there is no hero training or paying for stats. Skill and strategy are all you need to be able to win the intense competition on this fair and balanced platform. Play to Win, not Pay to Win.

4. Simple Controls, Easy to Master 
With a virtual joystick on the left and skill buttons on the right, 2 fingers are all you need to become a master! Autolock and target switching allow you to last hit to your heart’s content. Never miss! And a convenient tap-to-equip system allows you to buy equipment anywhere on the map so you can focus more on the thrill of battle!

5. 10 Second Matchmaking, 10 Minute Matches 
Matchmaking only takes 10 seconds. And a match only takes 10 minutes. Gloss over the quiet early-game leveling up and jump right into the intense battles. Less boring waiting and repetitive farming, and more thrilling actions and fist-pumping victories. At any place, at any moment, just pick up your phone, fire up the game, and immerse yourself in the heart-pounding MOBA competition.

6. Smart Offline AI Assistance 
A dropped connection could mean hanging your team out to dry in an intense match, but with Mobile Legends: Bang Bang’s powerful reconnection system, if you get dropped, you can be back in the battle in seconds. And while you’re offline, our AI system will take control of your character temporarily to avoid a 4-on-5 situation.
